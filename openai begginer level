---🧠 Agents:
Think of them as smart AI workers (LLMs) — each trained with special rules or tools (like web search or file reading). They understand what’s going on and decide what action or tool to use next.

🤝 Handoffs:
When one agent can’t handle a task, it passes (or “hands off”) the job to another agent that’s better suited for it — like teamwork between AI agents.

🛡️ Guardrails:
These are safety rules that check what agents say or do. They stop them from going beyond limits or making mistakes.

📊 Tracing & Observability:
This feature lets developers watch and debug what the agents are doing step by step — helpful for fixing issues and improving performance.
