---In AI, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting to structure data for both human and machine readability.
---Dynamic instruction in AI refers to giving AI systems flexible rules that change in real-time based on context, user input, or other variables,
rather than following a single, fixed instruction.
---Context management in AI is the process of supplying an AI agent with the relevant data it needs to perform a task, while strategically managing the limited space of 
its "context window" to prevent performance issues.
---error handling: input or output guardrils ki trf jarha h , tool ya function fail hogya us condition m kya hoga
---Pydantic models in AI are used to provide structure, validation, and type safety to the outputs of large language models (LLMs). Pydantic AI is a framework that leverages
Pydantic's data validation to turn messy, unstructured LLM responses into structured, reliable data for use in applications.
This approach simplifies building complex AI agents by allowing them to interact with domain-specific data, call external tools, and produce consistent, validated outputs. 
---Chain of of thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that enhances large language models' reasoning abilities by instructing them to break down complex problems into smaller, sequential steps
before providing a final answer.(reasoning krrha hoga hr step per kunke kisi model m reasoning ni hoti to us m COT kaam ata h jis m ham steps m kaam break down krty hn ky isko asy kro phr asy

---AGENTIC WORKFLOW:GPT-4.1 is a great place to build agentic workflows.(mtlb ham jitny bhi agentic workflow ki chizain istemal krrhy hn jese openai agent ya kkoi bhi third party framework 
bnany jese langgraph un sbko agr backend per yh gpt4.1 wala llm dedain to yh sbse best h)
An agentic workflow is a process where AI agents execute a complex task autonomously, making decisions and taking actions with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional
automation that follows fixed rules, these workflows use AI agents that can reason, adapt to real-time changes, and collaborate with humans to achieve goals more efficiently. 
-------SWE-bench verified:koi bhi repository ky issue, bug ya request ko automatically manage krna."SWE-bench Verified" means a set of real-world software engineering problems, 
sourced from actual GitHub issues, that have been human-validated to be solvable. It is a benchmark used to test and evaluate the capabilities of AI coding agents, particularly 
their ability to understand code, apply fixes, and autonomously validate their solutions in a single attempt, with no hints or scaffolding. 


---SYSTEM PROMPT REMINDERS:This explains three key system prompt reminders that improve GPT-4.1‚Äôs performance in agentic workflows (like coding or multi-step reasoning).

1. Persistence:(iteration m kam krrhy hn ky koi tool to cl ni krna ya kisi or agent se to help ni leni is trh different loops m kam krke user ky task ko complpete krengy )
Tell the model to keep working until the task is fully solved before returning control, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt stop too early.(jo bhi chizain horhi hn workflow m usy yad rkho tool calling,
function call kia handsoff kia or koi bhi chez istemal krrhy hn usy yad rkhega)
example:You are an agent - please keep going until the user‚Äôs query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.(is m please keep going wali line ka mtlb ky jo krrhy usy yd rkho or tbhi terminate krna tb problem solve ho .)

2. Tool-calling:
Instruct the model to use tools (like file reading or code inspection) when unsure, instead of guessing answers.(right time per right tool call krna
example:If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user‚Äôs request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant 
information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.(is trh wo khudse khud guess ni krega simple kehdia agr yh ni ata to simple toolcl krke file read krke information dedo
is trh wrong way m ni jyga hallucination ni krega)

3. Planning (optional):(planning ka mtlb chain of thoughts ky koi sawal kia to phly usko smjhengy phr apni knowledge se match krengy phr kch missing h to tool cl krengy us tool
ka purany information per kya asar hoga kese relate krega phr roadmap bnakr jawab dengy jo ky user ki need h ek perfect answer)
(reasoning to kch llm hoty hn but ab usy ek path dedngy to zyada bhtr hoga to uske liye COT ya planning zrori h lekin yh gpt4.1 non-reasoning h)
Ask the model to plan and reflect before and after tool calls, promoting thoughtful, step-by-step reasoning instead of blindly executing tasks.
example:You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only,
as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

These three reminders help shift GPT-4.1 from a chatbot mode to a more independent, problem-solving agent, improving performance (by about 20% in internal tests).
This means GPT-4.1 performs much better when given clear system prompts that include the three reminders: persistence, tool-calling, and planning.
In the agentic setting (where the model acts like an autonomous problem-solver instead of a passive chatbot), GPT-4.1 follows both user instructions and system rules very carefully.
By adding those three reminders:
It keeps working until the problem is solved (persistence),
Uses tools correctly instead of guessing (tool-calling), and
Thinks and plans each step carefully (planning).
Doing this improved their internal benchmark performance (SWE-bench Verified) by about 20%, proving that these instructions make GPT-4.1 behave more like an independent, proactive 
agent rather than just responding to messages like a chatbot.(55% m se 20% inho ne srf tbhi achieve krlia jb yh teen chizain ki)
(planning ki ky kese solve hoga yh task yh tool cl krna phr uske bd yh tool cl krna or dusry ka phly per kyaa impact parhega yh bhi dekhna is trh acha prompt hota h in teen chizon se)

----------TOOL CALLS-----------
Developers must use the API‚Äôs tools field (the built-in method) instead of adding tool info manually into the prompt.(normally ham function bnaty thy or decorater lgadety thy or function
ki sari detail ham system prompt m likhrhy hoty thy to isko imporve krke ab jo hamary pas tool description ki field hoti h tool field hoti h usy tools pass krty hn instead of adding
details in system prompt jb tool description m detail add ki to SWE-bench verified 2% increased hua
GPT-4.1 has improved training for handling tools automatically.
Older versions weren‚Äôt as good at understanding how to call tools or interpret tool responses.
üîπ ‚ÄúWe encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field‚Ä¶ rather than manually injecting tool descriptions‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° When using the OpenAI API, there‚Äôs a proper place called the tools field where you define all available tools.
Some developers used to paste tool details (like name, purpose, and parameters) directly into the system prompt ‚Äî that‚Äôs no longer recommended.
You should let the API handle tool definitions automatically.
üîπ ‚ÄúDevelopers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° Always give tools clear names that describe what they do.
Example:
‚ùå Bad name: tool1
‚úÖ Good name: search_web or generate_chart
üîπ ‚ÄúSimilarly, for each tool param, lean on good naming and descriptions‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° For every parameter (input) your tool accepts, give it:
A meaningful name (e.g., query, file_path)
A short explanation (e.g., ‚ÄúThe keyword to search for on the web‚Äù)
This ensures GPT-4.1 uses the parameters correctly.
üîπ ‚ÄúIf your tool is particularly complicated‚Ä¶ create an # Examples section in your system prompt‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° If the tool is complex, instead of stuffing long examples into the description, create a separate Examples section in your system prompt.
This helps GPT-4.1 understand how and when to call the tool ‚Äî without cluttering the description.
üîπ ‚ÄúYou can use ‚ÄòGenerate Anything‚Äô in the Prompt Playground‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° In the OpenAI Prompt Playground, there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúGenerate Anything‚Äù feature that can help you auto-generate example tool definitions ‚Äî a quick way to start writing clean tool setups.
üîπ ‚ÄúProviding examples can be helpful to indicate when to use tools‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° Example usage helps GPT-4.1 know:
When it should use a tool
Whether it needs to include user input in the call
Which parameters are suitable for different cases
üîπ ‚ÄúAdd a clear, detailed description in the ‚Äòdescription‚Äô field of the tool.‚Äù
‚û° Each tool has a description field. Write a short, precise explanation of what the tool does so GPT-4.1 knows when and how to use it.
üîπ ‚ÄúThis is the best way to minimize errors and ensure the model remains in distribution‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° Using the correct method (the tools field) helps:
Avoid errors (since the model reads tools in the expected format)
Keep the model ‚Äúin distribution‚Äù, meaning it behaves the way it was trained ‚Äî not confused by custom or unusual prompt structures.
üîπ ‚ÄúWe observed a 2% increase in SWE-bench Verified pass rate‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚û° When they tested both methods, using API-defined tools made GPT-4.1 perform 2% better on a programming benchmark called SWE-bench Verified, which measures accuracy on coding tasks.
‚úÖ In summary:
Define tools properly using the API‚Äôs tools field, not in your prompt.
Give each tool clear names, concise descriptions, and well-labeled parameters.
If tools are complex, add an # Examples section for clarity.
This makes GPT-4.1 use tools more accurately, safely, and effectively.


üîπ ‚ÄúPrompting-Induced Planning & Chain-of-Thought‚Äù
This title means that a developer can cause GPT-4.1 to plan and think step-by-step just through prompting ‚Äî by writing special instructions in the prompt.
‚ÄúChain-of-thought‚Äù refers to the model‚Äôs reasoning process ‚Äî a series of logical steps it follows to reach an answer.

üîπ ‚ÄúAs mentioned already, developers can optionally prompt agents built with GPT-4.1 to plan and reflect between tool calls, instead of silently calling tools in an unbroken sequence.‚Äù
This means:
Developers who create AI agents using GPT-4.1 can choose to make the model plan and reflect between each action or tool use.
Normally, GPT-4.1 might just run tools one after another automatically (for example, calling a search tool, then a code tool, then a file tool) without explaining what it‚Äôs doing.
But with the right prompt, developers can make GPT-4.1 pause, explain its reasoning, and reflect on what happened before taking the next step.
In short ‚Äî instead of acting like a robot that executes tasks, GPT-4.1 can be made to act like a human who plans each move carefully.

üîπ ‚ÄúGPT-4.1 is not a reasoning model - meaning that it does not produce an internal chain of thought before answering -‚Äù
This means GPT-4.1 does not naturally think silently in the background.
It doesn‚Äôt generate hidden reasoning steps or mental calculations that you can‚Äôt see.
It just reads the input and produces an output directly.
In other words, it doesn‚Äôt have an internal ‚Äúthought process‚Äù like humans or reasoning models (which might generate invisible intermediate steps before answering).

üîπ ‚Äúbut in the prompt, a developer can induce the model to produce an explicit, step-by-step plan by using any variant of the Planning prompt component shown above.‚Äù
Even though GPT-4.1 doesn‚Äôt think internally, developers can make it show its thinking through prompting.
‚ÄúInduce‚Äù means to cause or encourage something to happen.
‚ÄúExplicit‚Äù means clearly written out or visible.
So, by adding a Planning instruction in the prompt (for example: ‚ÄúPlease plan your steps carefully before solving this task‚Äù), developers can make GPT-4.1 write a visible,
step-by-step plan before completing the task.
This helps the model structure its reasoning clearly instead of jumping straight to an answer.

üîπ ‚ÄúThis can be thought of as the model ‚Äòthinking out loud.‚Äô‚Äù
This phrase means that when GPT-4.1 writes out its step-by-step plan, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs showing you its thoughts ‚Äî just as a person might speak their thought process aloud.
It‚Äôs not actually ‚Äúthinking‚Äù like a human, but it‚Äôs simulating the process by explaining what it‚Äôs going to do.

üîπ ‚ÄúIn our experimentation with the SWE-bench Verified agentic task, inducing explicit planning increased the pass rate by 4%.‚Äù
This means OpenAI tested this idea using a benchmark called SWE-bench Verified ‚Äî a dataset that measures how well AI agents solve software engineering (coding) problems.
They found that when GPT-4.1 was prompted to plan explicitly (write its step-by-step thoughts), it performed 4% better ‚Äî meaning it solved more tasks correctly.
So, prompting GPT-4.1 to plan and reflect improves accuracy and reasoning quality.

‚úÖ In summary:
GPT-4.1 doesn‚Äôt naturally have hidden reasoning (no internal chain of thought), but developers can prompt it to ‚Äúthink out loud‚Äù ‚Äî planning and reflecting step-by-step between
tool uses. This method, called prompting-induced planning, helps it solve problems more effectively ‚Äî increasing accuracy by 4% in experiments.

üß† 1. Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning Models in AI
Reasoning Models
These models are specifically trained to think step-by-step before giving an answer.
They create an internal ‚Äúchain of thought‚Äù ‚Äî meaning they reason through the problem internally, then provide the result.
They are better for complex logical tasks, like solving math problems, writing code, or multi-step reasoning (planning, cause-and-effect, etc.).
Example: Some versions of GPT-4 Turbo (reasoning models) are designed for tasks that require deep analysis or multi-step problem-solving.

üß© Example:
Q: If you have 3 apples and give away 1, how many are left?
A reasoning model will think internally: ‚Äú3 - 1 = 2‚Äù ‚Üí then answer ‚Äú2.‚Äù

Non-Reasoning Models
These models don‚Äôt have an internal reasoning process ‚Äî they generate answers directly from their training and the given prompt.
They can still perform well, but don‚Äôt explicitly ‚Äúthink‚Äù through each step unless you make them do it in the prompt.
Example: GPT-4.1 is a non-reasoning model. It can plan and reflect if you ask it to (through prompting), but it doesn‚Äôt automatically reason internally.

üß© Example:
Q: If you have 3 apples and give away 1, how many are left?
A non-reasoning model just knows the answer ‚Äú2‚Äù from memory ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt consciously think ‚Äú3 - 1 = 2.‚Äù

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Dynamic Instructions
Dynamic Instructions are a feature in AI systems that allow real-time, flexible guidance during conversations or workflows.
They change or adapt the model‚Äôs behavior depending on the situation or context.
Instead of using fixed system prompts (which never change), dynamic instructions can update automatically based on:
The user‚Äôs input
The current task
The conversation‚Äôs progress

üß© Example:
You might set a dynamic instruction like:
‚ÄúIf the user uploads a code file, switch to code analysis mode.‚Äù
Or:
‚ÄúIf the conversation becomes too long, summarize key points before continuing.‚Äù
So, dynamic instructions make AI more adaptive, context-aware, and responsive ‚Äî almost like it can ‚Äúshift gears‚Äù depending on what‚Äôs happening.

-----------What is a Context Window in AI?
A context window is the maximum amount of text (tokens) an AI model like GPT can ‚Äúsee,‚Äù ‚Äúremember,‚Äù and use at one time to generate a response.
It‚Äôs basically the model‚Äôs short-term memory for a single conversation or request.

üß† How It Works
When you chat with an AI, everything you and the model say gets turned into tokens (small pieces of words).
The model reads these tokens to understand the situation and generate the next part of the answer.
The context window decides how many tokens (words) the model can keep in mind at once.
If the total conversation exceeds the limit, older parts get ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù or cut off ‚Äî the model can no longer access them.

üî¢ Example
Let‚Äôs say:
GPT-4.1 has a 1 million token context window (very large).
You write a huge book or give it thousands of pages of code ‚Äî it can still read, remember, and reason over all of it in one go.
Older models had smaller context windows (like 8k or 32k tokens), meaning they could only handle a few pages at a time.

--------------------Context Window:
The maximum amount of text the AI can read, remember, and use at one time.
üß© Example: GPT-4.1 can handle up to 1 million tokens.

Token:
A small piece of text ‚Äî it can be a word or part of a word.
üß© Example: The word ‚ÄúHello‚Äù counts as 1 token.

If the Limit Is Exceeded:
The model forgets older parts of the conversation or text.
üß© Example: Earlier chat messages get cut off when the limit is reached.

----üí° Why It Matters
A large context window means the AI can:
Understand long documents, books, or codebases
Keep track of long conversations
Answer complex questions using many sources at once
