---In AI, Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting to structure data for both human and machine readability.
---Dynamic instruction in AI refers to giving AI systems flexible rules that change in real-time based on context, user input, or other variables,
rather than following a single, fixed instruction.
---Context management in AI is the process of supplying an AI agent with the relevant data it needs to perform a task, while strategically managing the limited space of 
its "context window" to prevent performance issues.
---error handling: input or output guardrils ki trf jarha h , tool ya function fail hogya us condition m kya hoga
---Pydantic models in AI are used to provide structure, validation, and type safety to the outputs of large language models (LLMs). Pydantic AI is a framework that leverages
Pydantic's data validation to turn messy, unstructured LLM responses into structured, reliable data for use in applications.
This approach simplifies building complex AI agents by allowing them to interact with domain-specific data, call external tools, and produce consistent, validated outputs. 
---Chain of of thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that enhances large language models' reasoning abilities by instructing them to break down complex problems into smaller, sequential steps
before providing a final answer.(reasoning krrha hoga hr step per kunke kisi model m reasoning ni hoti to us m COT kaam ata h jis m ham steps m kaam break down krty hn ky isko asy kro phr asy

---AGENTIC WORKFLOW:GPT-4.1 is a great place to build agentic workflows.(mtlb ham jitny bhi agentic workflow ki chizain istemal krrhy hn jese openai agent ya kkoi bhi third party framework 
bnany jese langgraph un sbko agr backend per yh gpt4.1 wala llm dedain to yh sbse best h)
An agentic workflow is a process where AI agents execute a complex task autonomously, making decisions and taking actions with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional
automation that follows fixed rules, these workflows use AI agents that can reason, adapt to real-time changes, and collaborate with humans to achieve goals more efficiently. 
-------SWE-bench verified:koi bhi repository ky issue, bug ya request ko automatically manage krna."SWE-bench Verified" means a set of real-world software engineering problems, 
sourced from actual GitHub issues, that have been human-validated to be solvable. It is a benchmark used to test and evaluate the capabilities of AI coding agents, particularly 
their ability to understand code, apply fixes, and autonomously validate their solutions in a single attempt, with no hints or scaffolding. 


---SYSTEM PROMPT REMINDERS:This explains three key system prompt reminders that improve GPT-4.1’s performance in agentic workflows (like coding or multi-step reasoning).

1. Persistence:(iteration m kam krrhy hn ky koi tool to cl ni krna ya kisi or agent se to help ni leni is trh different loops m kam krke user ky task ko complpete krengy )
Tell the model to keep working until the task is fully solved before returning control, ensuring it doesn’t stop too early.(jo bhi chizain horhi hn workflow m usy yad rkho tool calling,
function call kia handsoff kia or koi bhi chez istemal krrhy hn usy yad rkhega)
example:You are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.(is m please keep going wali line ka mtlb ky jo krrhy usy yd rkho or tbhi terminate krna tb problem solve ho .)

2. Tool-calling:
Instruct the model to use tools (like file reading or code inspection) when unsure, instead of guessing answers.(right time per right tool call krna
example:If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant 
information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.(is trh wo khudse khud guess ni krega simple kehdia agr yh ni ata to simple toolcl krke file read krke information dedo
is trh wrong way m ni jyga hallucination ni krega)

3. Planning (optional):(planning ka mtlb chain of thoughts ky koi sawal kia to phly usko smjhengy phr apni knowledge se match krengy phr kch missing h to tool cl krengy us tool
ka purany information per kya asar hoga kese relate krega phr roadmap bnakr jawab dengy jo ky user ki need h ek perfect answer)
(reasoning to kch llm hoty hn but ab usy ek path dedngy to zyada bhtr hoga to uske liye COT ya planning zrori h lekin yh gpt4.1 non-reasoning h)
Ask the model to plan and reflect before and after tool calls, promoting thoughtful, step-by-step reasoning instead of blindly executing tasks.
example:You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only,
as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.

These three reminders help shift GPT-4.1 from a chatbot mode to a more independent, problem-solving agent, improving performance (by about 20% in internal tests).
This means GPT-4.1 performs much better when given clear system prompts that include the three reminders: persistence, tool-calling, and planning.
In the agentic setting (where the model acts like an autonomous problem-solver instead of a passive chatbot), GPT-4.1 follows both user instructions and system rules very carefully.
By adding those three reminders:
It keeps working until the problem is solved (persistence),
Uses tools correctly instead of guessing (tool-calling), and
Thinks and plans each step carefully (planning).
Doing this improved their internal benchmark performance (SWE-bench Verified) by about 20%, proving that these instructions make GPT-4.1 behave more like an independent, proactive 
agent rather than just responding to messages like a chatbot.(55% m se 20% inho ne srf tbhi achieve krlia jb yh teen chizain ki)
(planning ki ky kese solve hoga yh task yh tool cl krna phr uske bd yh tool cl krna or dusry ka phly per kyaa impact parhega yh bhi dekhna is trh acha prompt hota h in teen chizon se)

----------TOOL CALLS-----------
Developers must use the API’s tools field (the built-in method) instead of adding tool info manually into the prompt.(normally ham function bnaty thy or decorater lgadety thy or function
ki sari detail ham system prompt m likhrhy hoty thy to isko imporve krke ab jo hamary pas tool description ki field hoti h tool field hoti h usy tools pass krty hn instead of adding
details in system prompt jb tool description m detail add ki to SWE-bench verified 2% increased hua
GPT-4.1 has improved training for handling tools automatically.
Older versions weren’t as good at understanding how to call tools or interpret tool responses.
🔹 “We encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field… rather than manually injecting tool descriptions…”
➡ When using the OpenAI API, there’s a proper place called the tools field where you define all available tools.
Some developers used to paste tool details (like name, purpose, and parameters) directly into the system prompt — that’s no longer recommended.
You should let the API handle tool definitions automatically.
🔹 “Developers should name tools clearly to indicate their purpose…”
➡ Always give tools clear names that describe what they do.
Example:
❌ Bad name: tool1
✅ Good name: search_web or generate_chart
🔹 “Similarly, for each tool param, lean on good naming and descriptions…”
➡ For every parameter (input) your tool accepts, give it:
A meaningful name (e.g., query, file_path)
A short explanation (e.g., “The keyword to search for on the web”)
This ensures GPT-4.1 uses the parameters correctly.
🔹 “If your tool is particularly complicated… create an # Examples section in your system prompt…”
➡ If the tool is complex, instead of stuffing long examples into the description, create a separate Examples section in your system prompt.
This helps GPT-4.1 understand how and when to call the tool — without cluttering the description.
🔹 “You can use ‘Generate Anything’ in the Prompt Playground…”
➡ In the OpenAI Prompt Playground, there’s a “Generate Anything” feature that can help you auto-generate example tool definitions — a quick way to start writing clean tool setups.
🔹 “Providing examples can be helpful to indicate when to use tools…”
➡ Example usage helps GPT-4.1 know:
When it should use a tool
Whether it needs to include user input in the call
Which parameters are suitable for different cases
🔹 “Add a clear, detailed description in the ‘description’ field of the tool.”
➡ Each tool has a description field. Write a short, precise explanation of what the tool does so GPT-4.1 knows when and how to use it.
🔹 “This is the best way to minimize errors and ensure the model remains in distribution…”
➡ Using the correct method (the tools field) helps:
Avoid errors (since the model reads tools in the expected format)
Keep the model “in distribution”, meaning it behaves the way it was trained — not confused by custom or unusual prompt structures.
🔹 “We observed a 2% increase in SWE-bench Verified pass rate…”
➡ When they tested both methods, using API-defined tools made GPT-4.1 perform 2% better on a programming benchmark called SWE-bench Verified, which measures accuracy on coding tasks.
✅ In summary:
Define tools properly using the API’s tools field, not in your prompt.
Give each tool clear names, concise descriptions, and well-labeled parameters.
If tools are complex, add an # Examples section for clarity.
This makes GPT-4.1 use tools more accurately, safely, and effectively.


🔹 “Prompting-Induced Planning & Chain-of-Thought”
This title means that a developer can cause GPT-4.1 to plan and think step-by-step just through prompting — by writing special instructions in the prompt.
“Chain-of-thought” refers to the model’s reasoning process — a series of logical steps it follows to reach an answer.

🔹 “As mentioned already, developers can optionally prompt agents built with GPT-4.1 to plan and reflect between tool calls, instead of silently calling tools in an unbroken sequence.”
This means:
Developers who create AI agents using GPT-4.1 can choose to make the model plan and reflect between each action or tool use.
Normally, GPT-4.1 might just run tools one after another automatically (for example, calling a search tool, then a code tool, then a file tool) without explaining what it’s doing.
But with the right prompt, developers can make GPT-4.1 pause, explain its reasoning, and reflect on what happened before taking the next step.
In short — instead of acting like a robot that executes tasks, GPT-4.1 can be made to act like a human who plans each move carefully.

🔹 “GPT-4.1 is not a reasoning model - meaning that it does not produce an internal chain of thought before answering -”
This means GPT-4.1 does not naturally think silently in the background.
It doesn’t generate hidden reasoning steps or mental calculations that you can’t see.
It just reads the input and produces an output directly.
In other words, it doesn’t have an internal “thought process” like humans or reasoning models (which might generate invisible intermediate steps before answering).

🔹 “but in the prompt, a developer can induce the model to produce an explicit, step-by-step plan by using any variant of the Planning prompt component shown above.”
Even though GPT-4.1 doesn’t think internally, developers can make it show its thinking through prompting.
“Induce” means to cause or encourage something to happen.
“Explicit” means clearly written out or visible.
So, by adding a Planning instruction in the prompt (for example: “Please plan your steps carefully before solving this task”), developers can make GPT-4.1 write a visible,
step-by-step plan before completing the task.
This helps the model structure its reasoning clearly instead of jumping straight to an answer.

🔹 “This can be thought of as the model ‘thinking out loud.’”
This phrase means that when GPT-4.1 writes out its step-by-step plan, it’s like it’s showing you its thoughts — just as a person might speak their thought process aloud.
It’s not actually “thinking” like a human, but it’s simulating the process by explaining what it’s going to do.

🔹 “In our experimentation with the SWE-bench Verified agentic task, inducing explicit planning increased the pass rate by 4%.”
This means OpenAI tested this idea using a benchmark called SWE-bench Verified — a dataset that measures how well AI agents solve software engineering (coding) problems.
They found that when GPT-4.1 was prompted to plan explicitly (write its step-by-step thoughts), it performed 4% better — meaning it solved more tasks correctly.
So, prompting GPT-4.1 to plan and reflect improves accuracy and reasoning quality.

✅ In summary:
GPT-4.1 doesn’t naturally have hidden reasoning (no internal chain of thought), but developers can prompt it to “think out loud” — planning and reflecting step-by-step between
tool uses. This method, called prompting-induced planning, helps it solve problems more effectively — increasing accuracy by 4% in experiments.

🧠 1. Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning Models in AI
Reasoning Models
These models are specifically trained to think step-by-step before giving an answer.
They create an internal “chain of thought” — meaning they reason through the problem internally, then provide the result.
They are better for complex logical tasks, like solving math problems, writing code, or multi-step reasoning (planning, cause-and-effect, etc.).
Example: Some versions of GPT-4 Turbo (reasoning models) are designed for tasks that require deep analysis or multi-step problem-solving.

🧩 Example:
Q: If you have 3 apples and give away 1, how many are left?
A reasoning model will think internally: “3 - 1 = 2” → then answer “2.”

Non-Reasoning Models
These models don’t have an internal reasoning process — they generate answers directly from their training and the given prompt.
They can still perform well, but don’t explicitly “think” through each step unless you make them do it in the prompt.
Example: GPT-4.1 is a non-reasoning model. It can plan and reflect if you ask it to (through prompting), but it doesn’t automatically reason internally.

🧩 Example:
Q: If you have 3 apples and give away 1, how many are left?
A non-reasoning model just knows the answer “2” from memory — it doesn’t consciously think “3 - 1 = 2.”

⚙️ 2. Dynamic Instructions
Dynamic Instructions are a feature in AI systems that allow real-time, flexible guidance during conversations or workflows.
They change or adapt the model’s behavior depending on the situation or context.
Instead of using fixed system prompts (which never change), dynamic instructions can update automatically based on:
The user’s input
The current task
The conversation’s progress

🧩 Example:
You might set a dynamic instruction like:
“If the user uploads a code file, switch to code analysis mode.”
Or:
“If the conversation becomes too long, summarize key points before continuing.”
So, dynamic instructions make AI more adaptive, context-aware, and responsive — almost like it can “shift gears” depending on what’s happening.

-----------What is a Context Window in AI?
A context window is the maximum amount of text (tokens) an AI model like GPT can “see,” “remember,” and use at one time to generate a response.
It’s basically the model’s short-term memory for a single conversation or request.

🧠 How It Works
When you chat with an AI, everything you and the model say gets turned into tokens (small pieces of words).
The model reads these tokens to understand the situation and generate the next part of the answer.
The context window decides how many tokens (words) the model can keep in mind at once.
If the total conversation exceeds the limit, older parts get “forgotten” or cut off — the model can no longer access them.

🔢 Example
Let’s say:
GPT-4.1 has a 1 million token context window (very large).
You write a huge book or give it thousands of pages of code — it can still read, remember, and reason over all of it in one go.
Older models had smaller context windows (like 8k or 32k tokens), meaning they could only handle a few pages at a time.

--------------------Context Window:
The maximum amount of text the AI can read, remember, and use at one time.
🧩 Example: GPT-4.1 can handle up to 1 million tokens.

Token:
A small piece of text — it can be a word or part of a word.
🧩 Example: The word “Hello” counts as 1 token.

If the Limit Is Exceeded:
The model forgets older parts of the conversation or text.
🧩 Example: Earlier chat messages get cut off when the limit is reached.

----💡 Why It Matters
A large context window means the AI can:
Understand long documents, books, or codebases
Keep track of long conversations
Answer complex questions using many sources at once



---------------------------------------------------------------MARKDOWN-------------------------------------------------------
---markdown standard format ha

----Markup Language
Definition: A markup language is used to structure, format, and display text.
Purpose: It “marks up” text with tags to tell computers how to display or process it.
Examples:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) → Used for web pages.
XML (Extensible Markup Language) → Used for storing and transporting data.
Example Syntax (HTML):
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

✍️ Markdown Language
Definition: Markdown is a lightweight markup language created for easy text formatting using simple symbols.
Purpose: To write formatted text that’s easy to read in plain text and can convert to HTML.
Commonly used in: README files, documentation, and blogging platforms like GitHub or Reddit.
Example Syntax (Markdown):
# Hello World
This is a **bold** word and *italic* word.

----------
🔍 Main Differences between Markup Language and Markdown

Syntax:
Markup uses tags like <h1> or <p>.
Markdown uses symbols like #, **, or *.

Complexity:
Markup is more complex and detailed.
Markdown is very simple and easy to learn.

Output:
Markup produces structured webpages (e.g., HTML documents).
Markdown converts to HTML or styled text.

Readability:
Markup is harder to read in its raw form.
Markdown is easy to read even without rendering.

-------------👉 All Markdown is a type of markup, but not all markup is Markdown.

--markdown html m bhi convert hojata h agr backend per markdown use kryn or markdown or html markup language h dono web designing keliye use hoti hn

----Here’s why Markdown is important 👇

Simplicity:
It’s easy to learn and write — no complex tags like HTML.

Readability:
Text remains clear and readable even without formatting applied.

Portability:
Works across many platforms (GitHub, Reddit, Notion, etc.).

Conversion:
Can be easily converted into HTML, PDF, or other formats.

Efficiency:
Helps write formatted content quickly using minimal syntax.

Version Control Friendly:
Since it’s plain text, tools like Git can easily track changes.

Used in Documentation:
Commonly used for README files, blogs, and software documentation.

----Heading Best Practices
✅  Do this	:(hash ky bd space dena h tbhi heading bnegi)
# Here's a Heading

❌  Don't do this:
#Here's a Heading

✅  Do this	
Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.

❌  Don't do this
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
# Heading
Don't do this!

---paragraph means jo text chlta jarha h jese hi enter krengy mtlb do lines ky beech lines agai to whin paragraph khtm hogya

---------------------Paragraphs:
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Markdown:
I really like using Markdown.I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.(yh ek paragraph bnega or html m <p></p> is p tag se paragraph bnta ha.)
(isy jb ham vs per paste krengy or previewkrengy to yh ek paragph hoga paragraph normally likh skty markdown m bs blank line agai to whn paragraph khtm hoga.

----2 lines hn unke beech extra line h to wo do paragraph consider kiye jyngy. agr do lines ky beech m extra line ni h to wo ek paragraph bn jyga yh markdown m hota h lekin agr 
<p> ky sth asa kren ky do lines ky beech extra line na ho wo tb bhi 2 paragraph hi consider krega


--------MARKDOWN----------
----
I really like using Markdown.
I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.(ab yh dono lines single paragraph hi hongi)

----
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.(ab yh do alg alg paragraph hongy)

----------HTML------------
<p>I really like using Markdown.</p>
<p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>(ab bhi yh do paragraph hi hn bhaly koi line na ho)


----------PARAGRAPH BEST PRACTICE--------------
✅  Do this
Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.


❌  Don't do this
    This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.


-----line breaks------:To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
Markdown:
This is the first line.(next line per agaye to new line bn gai or agr beech m extra line chordi to wo 2 paragraph hojyngy)  
And this is the second line.

HTML:
<p>This is the first line.<br>(paragraph m <br> se next line per ajata ha agr kch paragraph ky andr next line per krna h to)
And this is the second line.</p>

output of both html and markdown is:
This is the first line.
And this is the second line.

------line break best practice--------(enter or <br> is best "\" or spaces are not too good)
1.Trailing whitespace (two spaces) can be used for line breaks in most Markdown apps.
2.It’s controversial because trailing spaces are hard to see and may be added accidentally.
3.A better alternative is using the HTML <br> tag for clear line breaks.
4.For best compatibility, use either two spaces or the <br> tag at the end of a line.
5.Using a backslash (\) for line breaks is not recommended — not all Markdown apps support it.
6.Some markup languages automatically create line breaks when you press Enter, but this is not standard Markdown behavior.

✅  Do this	
First line with two spaces after.   (yhn per do spaces hn to nichy wali line next m chali jygi but yh nzr ni ayngy to kch bhi hoskta ghlti se likhdy koi tbhi <br> tag use krty dono krskty
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.


❌  Don't do this
First line with a backslash after.\(yh krna recommended ni h)
And the next line.

First line with nothing after.(spaces ni dalengy or nichy krke dusri line dal dengy tb bhi yh ek paragraph hi rhega next line ni hogi)
And the next line.

------------------------Bold---------------------
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
 
            Markdown                                                     	HTML

Love**is**bold	(is bold hokr ajyga)                         Love<strong>is</strong>bold	   


-------------------------Bold Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.

✅  Do this	              ❌Don't do this:
Love**is**bold	            Love__is__bold


-----------------------Italic: (thora terha krke jo likha ata)
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.(cats meow bold hokr ajyga)      	Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.	
A*cat*meow(cat bold hokr ajyga)                                               	A<em>cat</em>meow

---------------------Italic Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.

✅  Do this	        ❌  Don't do this
A*cat*meow	             A_cat_meow

----------------Blockquotes---------
To create a blockquote, add a ">" in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
(iska output yh hoga ky paragraph ya line ky shuru m horizontal bold line ajygi jo btygi yh blockquote h)

---------Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.(ab yh teeno lines quote hojyngi or inke shuru  horizontal moti bold line ajani or yh
ek block quote hoga)

--------------Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.(ab is m hoga yh ky phly yh teen lines bary horizontal m aygi lekin jo third line h
jis m >> h to uske pas ek apna horizontal bold line bhi hogi mtlb ek puri teeno per or uske andr teesri per ek alg bhi hogi)

------------ab nested or chaiye to or bhi hongy:
>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.(teen hongy)
>>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.(4 hongy)
>>>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>>>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.(6 bhi hongy or usy zyada bhi but 2 tk sai rhengy)

-------------------Blockquotes with Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!(4 hash mtlb heading ka level 4 hoga blockquotes m)
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.(hiphen ky sign se bullets bnti hn to yh do bullets hongi)
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.(ab is m everything italic hoga or plan bold hoga)

-----------Blockquotes Best Practices
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

✅  Do this	
Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote.	(shuru or akhir m blank line dedo blockquote ky takay sbse diffrerent dikhay mix na ho conjusted na ho)

❌  Don't do this
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
> This is a blockquote
Don't do this!


-----------------------Lists---------------------------
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

--------------------Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

Markdown:
1. First item(1. ky bd space dena zrori h wrna nichy waly sary 1. wali line m hi ajyngy)
2. Second item(2. ky bd space dena zrori h wrna nichy waly sary 2. wali line m hi ajyngy isi trh 3 or 4 ky bd bhi line dena ha)
3. Third item
4. Fourth item	
 
output:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
4.Fourth item

Markdown:
1. First item(agr shuru m 1. dala ha or baqi bhaly nichy sequence ghlt h tb bhi wo isi 1 2 3 hi krega linewise)
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

output:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
4.Fourth item

Markdown:
1. First item(numbering alg alg dengy but 1. se shuru ki h tb bhi wo 1 2 3 hi consider krega or agr sbse phly 2 hua to 2 3 4 krega 3 hua first per to 3 4 5 krega is trh but sequence hoga)
8. Second item
3. Third item
5. Fourth item

output:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
4.Fourth item

Markdown:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

output:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
    1.Indented item
    2.Indented item
4.Fourth item


----------------------Ordered List Best Practices-------------------
CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), but not all Markdown applications support this,
so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.

✅  Do this	                
1. First item
2. Second item

❌  Don't do this:(bracket ni lgega)
1) First item
2) Second item


-------------------------Unordered Lists-------------------------
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

Markdown:(- yh lgany se output m round black color se fill huy vy circle ajany
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

output:(sbke shuru m round black color ky circle ajayngy yhn show ni horhy but preview se hongy)
First item
Second item
Third item
Fourth item

Markdown:(stearic ky sign se bhi same output ayga or + se bhi wohi output ayga jo - hiphen se aya tha round black small circle)
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item


Markdown:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

output:(jo first second third or fourth iteem hn unke pas wohi black rounde circle ayga lekin jo do indented item hn unka circle transparent ayga without black color)
First item
Second item
Third item
     Indented item
     Indented item
 Fourth item

Markdown:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
        - nested indented item
- Fourth item

output:(jo first second third or fourth iteem hn unke pas wohi black rounde circle ayga lekin jo  indented item hn uska circle transparent ayga without black color or jo nested indented
item h uska square ayga black color ka)
First item
Second item
Third item
      Indented item
        Indented item
Fourth item


------------------------Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers
If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

Markdown:(agr 1968 ky agay \ ni dalengy to wo isy ek number list hi consider krega to markdown ko yh btana ky 1968. ko normal text consider kro "." ko normal consider kro to uske liye
backslash dalengy)
- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.	

output:(ab in dono ko yh lines hi consider krega or dono ky shuru m black circle ajyngy)
1968. A great year!
I think 1969 was second best.

-----------------------Unordered List Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.

✅  Do this	
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item	

❌  Don't do this
+ First item
* Second item
- Third item
+ Fourth item




--------------------------Adding Elements in Lists------------------------
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.


Markdown:
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.


------The rendered output looks like this:

This is the first list item.(jis jis ky shuru m stearic h wo bullets bn jyngi mtlb black circle ajyngy or beech ki line i need to wali baghair bullet ky hogi jo btygi ky yh list m alg h)
Here’s the second list item.

I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.(yh paragraph bn jana)

And here’s the third list item.


Blockquotes(agr beech m blockquote chaiye to bhi wohi kam krengy bs blockquote keliye > sign lgadengy takay baqi bullets m rhyn or srf beech wali line blockquote bny mtlb uske shuru m 
hrizonatal line ajaye)
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

The rendered output looks like this:(beech wali line blockquote hogi or baqi teen stearic waly bullets hongy)

This is the first list item.
Here’s the second list item.

A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

And here’s the third list item.


---------------------------Code Blocks------------------
Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.


Markdown:
1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>(yh beech wala html wala code block bnjana )
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.


The rendered output looks like this:

1.Open the file.
2.Find the following code block on line 21:

 <html>
   <head>
     <title>Test</title>
   </head>

3.Update the title to match the name of your website.


-----------------Images---------------

Markdown:
1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](/assets/images/tux.png)(output m iski jagah image ajygi)(image lgany keliye shuru m ! ka mark dalty hn uske bd text likhty hn jo image ky nichy ay or akhir
m image ki link deddety to whn se image smny nzr aygi)(agr kisi bhi wjh se image load na ho to jo text h [] is m wo ajana or uske shuru m chota sa eror pic bni aygi mtlb pic missing h 
ya load ni hui)

3. Close the file.



---------------------Lists
You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

Markdown:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
4. Fourth item

output:(1 2 3 4 waly to numbering m hi rhengy lrkin jinke sth - h wo circle bnjyngy without black color

1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item
    Indented item
    Indented item
4.Fourth item


<code>            (isy bhi codeblock bnta ha)
x=4
</code>


(agr ``` backticks waly m naam ni likhengy python java ya markdown tb bhi wo blockcode hi consider hoga but lnaguage likhny se colors ajany jese python m varibale ka color alg hota 
data type ka alg to wo color ajany)
```markdown        (isy bhi code block lgta h markdown ki jagah python likhdo ya java to ussi ka codeblock bn jana
> hey
```

summary:
The triple backticks (```) start and end a code block.
<code>...</code> is HTML code tag, also used to display code in Markdown.

---------------Both methods (backticks and <code>) are valid for showing code in Markdown —
Backticks → Markdown syntax
<code> → HTML syntax inside Markdown


---------------------Code----------------------------
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).(triple backticks multiple lines ko blockcode bnany keliye or single backtick kisi word ka phrase ko blockcode bnany 
keliye use krty hn)

Markdown	                                                                HTML	                                              Rendered Output
At the command prompt, type `nano`.	                    At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code>.	                At the command prompt, type nano.
(output m srf nano word blockcode bna hua hoga)         (output m srf nano word blockcode bna hua hoga)


----------------------Escaping Backticks-----------------------
If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).

Markdown	                                                                    HTML	                                            Rendered Output
``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``                    	<code>Use `code` in your Markdown file.</code>	                Use `code` in your Markdown file.
(puri line blockcode hogi lekin us m code jo                 (puri line blockcode hogi lekin us m code jo 
 word h uske agay pichy backticks ajany)                      word h uske agay pichy backticks ajany)



--------------------------Code Blocks
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.(starting m 4 spaces dedo ya ek tab dedo tb bhi yh blockcode bnjana)

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

The rendered output looks like this:(yh block code hi bnega)
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>



----------------------Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule(line), use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

***

---

___

(agr 1 ya 2 dalengy *,-,_ to wo text hi consider hoga to zrori h teeno ko 3 rkhyn ya usy zyada )
The rendered output of all three looks identical(teeno se line hi bnegi)



--------------------------Horizontal Rule Best Practices
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

✅  Do this	
Try to put a blank line before...

---

...and after a horizontal rule.


❌  Don't do this
Without blank lines, this would be a heading.(blank line ni dalengy to yh wali line heading bn jani kunke kisi bhi line ky nichy --- hiphen lgao to wo heading bnany ka tareeka h)
---
Don't do this!


--------------------------Links--------------------
(ham direct link bhi paste krskty hn or wo link click hokr open bhi hogi but uska mtlb hua hamy markdown ni ata to isiliye yh format krna h link paste krny keliye)
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).(isy yh hoga jese word m ham kch likhty or agr ham chahty wo link bny to right click krke link paste krdety to 
test ka color blue hojata or wo link bn jati isi trh Duck Duck Go ko likhny ky foran bd link dedengy to wo link bn jani 

OUTPUT:
My favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.(Duck Duck Go ka color blue hojana yh link bn jaygi


-----------------------------Adding Titles-----------------------------
You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").(yh jo link aygi us per jb cursor lekr jyngy to hover krny per likha aygathe best 
search engine for privacy isi trh image paste krke bhi jo link h uske agay "" double quotation m jo bhi likhengy wo hover se ajana jb cursor lekr jyngy image per tb)


OUTPUT:
My favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.(Duck Duck Go YH link to h or hover krny per text likha bhi ana)



--------------------URLs and Email Addresses------------
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

MARKDOWN:(<> YH lgany se link or email bn jata)
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

Output:
https://www.markdownguide.org(links bni ayngi yh dono)
fake@example.com

------------------------Formatting Links
To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks in the brackets.

MARKDOWN:
I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.
See the section on [`code`](#code).(jo #code h yh anchor link h that points to a section within the same document. It links to a heading or element with the ID code. or jo [] is m word
code h wo link to bn jana but code block bhi bnjana kunke ` single backticks hn iske start or end m)

output:
I love supporting the EFF.(EFF yh link to bn jani lekin stearic ** ki madad se EFF bold bhi hojana)
This is the Markdown Guide.(Markdown Guide jo h wo single stearic * ki wjh se italic bn jana)
See the section on code.(code word jo h link or codeblock bn jyga)


-----------------Reference-style Links
Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline 
with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.

How it works:
They have two parts:
The first part is the text with a label → [text][label](text or link ky brackets ky beech m space na ho)
The second part is the link definition → [label]: URL "optional title"

Why use it:
Instead of putting long, messy URLs in your main text, you move them to the bottom (like footnotes).


----------------------------------example:
This is a [Markdown Guide][1].
[1]: https://www.markdownguide.org "Markdown Guide"

Result:
This is a Markdown Guide.(Markdown Guide link bn gya h or us per hover krny se Markdown Guide likha ayga)


example:
[hobbit-hole][1]   (hobbit-hole link bn gya h or nichy waly m se koi bhi choose kro link hi bnega)

----The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.
This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link:(nichy waly sb krskty sb titles ki types hn)
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles)
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> 'Hobbit lifestyles'
[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> (Hobbit lifestyles)


-----------------An Example Putting the Parts Together--------------------
Say you add a URL as a standard URL link to a paragraph and it looks like this in Markdown:

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.( is pury paragraph m word habbit-hole link bn jana or hover krny
per hobbit lifestyle bhi likha ana)


---------------------another example-------------------------
Though it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as displayed really doesn’t add much to the existing raw text other than making it harder to read. 
To fix that, you could format the URL like this instead:

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort.

[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> "Hobbit lifestyles"  (yh refrence wala zyada bhtr hoga upr wali example se kunke yh zyada clear or readable h)



-------------------------Link Best Practices (Easy Summary)----------------------
Spaces in URLs:
Markdown doesn’t handle spaces in web addresses properly.

To fix it, replace every space with %20.
✅ Correct:
[link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)

❌ Wrong:
[link](https://www.example.com/my great page)


Parentheses in URLs:
URLs with ( or ) can also break.

Replace them with:
( → %28
) → %29

✅ Correct:
[a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_%28novel%29)

❌ Wrong:
[a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_(novel))


Alternative Option:
If Markdown has issues with your link, you can safely use HTML <a> tags instead:

<a href="https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page">link</a>


✅ In short:
To make sure links always work in Markdown —
Replace spaces with %20
Replace parentheses with %28 and %29
Or use an HTML <a> tag for full compatibility.



Images
To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation 
marks after the path or URL.

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")(preview m image ajygi or hover krny per San Juan Mountains yh likha ayga)



--------------------Linking Images------------------------------
To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg "Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/beaurogers/31833779864/in/photolist-Qv3rFw-34mt9F-a9Cmfy

(image to aygi ab image ko click krny per ek link di h jis per chly jyngy click krny per)(round bracket m end per link dedengy jo click hokr open hogi wo)




------------------🧩 Escaping Characters in Markdown---------------
To show a literal character (that Markdown normally uses for formatting), add a backslash (\) before it.
Example: \* → renders as * and not as a bullet point.

Rendered Example:
\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.(agr backslash na hoti to * ki wjh se is line ko bullet point smh jata or black circle ajata shuru m kunke hamy 
input m \* lgaya h to * isko as a character hi lega
output :   * Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

✅ Characters You Can Escape
You can use a backslash (\) to escape these characters:
\ (backslash)
` (backtick)
* (asterisk)
_ (underscore)
{ } (curly braces)
(brackets)
< > (angle brackets)
(parentheses)
# (pound sign)
+ (plus sign)
- (minus sign)
. (dot)
! (exclamation mark)
| (pipe symbol)

🧠 Using HTML in Markdown
Markdown allows embedding HTML tags directly in text.
This is useful when:
You prefer HTML syntax for images or text.
You want to change attributes (like color, size, width, etc.).(jese image dalengy to uski width manage krni to html use krskty)

Example:
This **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic.

output:(word bold ajana or word italic bhi hojana
This word is bold. This word is italic.

⚙️ HTML Best Practices:
⚠️ Not all Markdown applications support HTML. Some only allow specific tags for security reasons.
Always check your Markdown app’s documentation for HTML compatibility.
Use blank lines before and after block-level HTML elements like <div>, <table>, <pre>, or <p> for correct formatting.
Avoid indenting HTML tags with spaces or tabs — this can break the layout.
You cannot use Markdown syntax inside HTML tags.
Example: <p>italic and **bold**</p> ❌ (will not render correctly)

✅ In short:
Use a backslash \ to display Markdown symbols as text, and HTML tags when you need more control over formatting — but follow best practices for compatibility and security.



-----llm simple text bhi smjhta h but llm train markdown per bhi hua h blky sbse zyada system instruction markdown m h to agr ham input markdown m dengy to bhtr smjhega ab ham ek lmba
prompt derhy to us m heading hongi kahin word bold hoga kahin bullets hongi to un sb ko ham kese prompt m bold ya bara krengy to uske liye ham markdown ko use krngy jisy llm acha
smjhega.



🌟 Extended Syntax in Markdown
Extended syntax adds extra features to Markdown beyond the basics (like bold, lists, and links).
👉 Not every Markdown app supports these features, so compatibility may vary.

🧱 1. Tables
Used to display data in rows and columns.
Syntax:

| Syntax | Description |
